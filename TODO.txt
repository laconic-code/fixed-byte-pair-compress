# Word Encoding

dictionary building:
  track words at a time and include them in the sorting + selection.
  is there a way to do this on a non-word boundary?

encoding:
  start from the end of the word section OFFSET and perform strncmps
  ```c
    idx = DICTIONARY_WORD_IDX
    offset = DICTIONARY_WORD_OFFSET;
    while (idx < DICTIONARY_LENGTH) {
        entry = Dictionary + offset;
        if (strncmp(entry, strlen(entry), source) == 0) {
            // set code and return
        } else {
            idx += 1;
            offset += strlen(entry) + 1;
        }
    }
  ```

decoding:
  ```c
    if (code > DICTIONARY_WORD_IDX) {
        idx = code - DICTIONARY_WORD_IDX;
        offset = DICTIONARY_WORD_OFFSET;
        while (idx != idx) {
            idx += 1;
            offset += strlen(entry) + 1;
        }
        memcpy(destination, offset, len(offset));
    }
  ```
